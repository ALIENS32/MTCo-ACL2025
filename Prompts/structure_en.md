We plan to evaluate a large language model's ability to follow instructions in multi-turn dialogues. To achieve this, we have designed three complex scenarios and hope to establish multi-turn dialogue structure templates to guide the creation of the evaluation dataset. This will help test whether the model can correctly continue, clarify, recall, expand, and summarize conversations based on user prompts.

The following Python code represents the structure of multi-turn dialogues between a human and a large language model. Each instance of the `Node` class represents one turn of dialogue, which includes a question from the user and a response from the large language model. The number in the node name (e.g., `k1`) indicates the position of that turn within the entire dialogue sequence.

There are two types of relationships between two turns of dialogue:
- **Follow-up**: The user asks a new question or comments based on the large language model's response from the previous turn. This relationship is represented by a solid line.
- **Refinement**: The user modifies or clarifies a previous prompt, possibly to correct information or express it more clearly. This relationship is represented by a dashed line.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.edges = []

    def add_follow_up(self, target):
        # Add a follow-up relationship, represented by a solid line
        edge = Edge(self, target, 'solid')
        self.edges.append(edge)

    def add_refinement(self, target):
        # Add a refinement relationship, represented by a dashed line
        edge = Edge(self, target, 'dashed')
        self.edges.append(edge)
        
# Example: Follow-up relationship
node_k0 = Node('k0')  # Initial dialogue
node_k1 = Node('k1')  # First round of dialogue
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k1)  # k0 -> k1 Follow-up

# Example: Refinement relationship
node_k2 = Node('k2')  # Second round of dialogue
node_k1.add_refinement(node_k2)  # k1 -> k2 Refinement
```

In addition to the basic structures mentioned above, there are several other patterns of dialogue:

- **Recollection**: The user restarts the discussion based on an earlier round of dialogue. For example, the user might return to the initial point of conversation and ask a new question. Structure example:

```python
# Example: Recollection relationship
node_kn = Node('kn')  # New dialogue based on an earlier round
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_kn)  # k0 -> kn Recollection
```

- **Expansion**: After understanding a topic, the user explores different aspects of that topic in subsequent dialogues. Structure example:

```python
# Example: Expansion relationship
node_k3 = Node('k3')  # Exploring a new subtopic
node_k3 = Node('k2')  # Exploring a new subtopic
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k3)  # k0 -> k3 Expansion
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k2)  # k0 -> k3 Expansion
```

- **Summary**: The user asks the large language model to summarize the content of previous rounds of dialogue. Structure example:

```python
# Example: Summary relationship
node_summary = Node('summary')  # Summary node
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k0 -> summary
node_k1.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k1 -> summary
node_k2.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k2 -> summary
```
