Please understand the following content so that in the subsequent conversation, you can describe the dialogue structure using code based on this information.

### Background
We aim to evaluate the ability of large language models to follow instructions in multi-turn dialogues. To achieve this goal, we have designed three complex scenarios and plan to guide the creation of an evaluation dataset by establishing multi-turn dialogue structure templates. These dialogue structures are based on five fundamental types: follow-up, refinement, recollection, expansion, and summary. We hope to describe the dialogue structures under complex scenarios based on these five fundamental types.

### Describing Dialogue Structure Using Code
We use the following Python code to describe the aforementioned five basic dialogue structures.

Each instance of the `Node` class represents a turn in the dialogue, including a question from the user and a response from the large language model. The numbers in the node names (such as the instance `k1` representing the first turn) indicate the position of that turn within the entire dialogue sequence.

There are only two types of relationships between two turns of dialogue:
- **Follow-up**: The user poses new questions or comments based on the large language model's response from the previous turn. This relationship is represented by a solid line.
- **Refinement**: The user modifies or clarifies a previous prompt, possibly to correct information or express something more clearly. This relationship is represented by a dashed line.

To reiterate, there are only two types of relationships between different turns in the multi-turn dialogue structure: follow-up and refinement!

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.edges = []

    def add_follow_up(self, target): # There is a follow-up relationship between self and target
        pass

    def add_refinement(self, target): # There is a refinement relationship between self and target
        pass

# Example: Follow-up relationship
node_k0 = Node('k0')  # Initial dialogue
node_k1 = Node('k1')  # First turn
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k1)  # k0 -> k1 follow-up

# Example: Refinement relationship
node_k2 = Node('k2')  # Second turn
node_k1.add_refinement(node_k2)  # k1 -> k2 refinement
```

In addition to the basic structures mentioned above, there are also the following dialogue patterns:

- **Recollection**: The user restarts the discussion based on an earlier turn of dialogue. For example, the user might return to the initial point of dialogue and pose a new question. An example structure is as follows:

```python
# Example: Recollection relationship
node_kn = Node('kn')  # New dialogue based on an early turn
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_kn)  # k0 -> kn recollection
```

- **Expansion**: After understanding a topic, the user explores different aspects of it in subsequent dialogues. An example structure is as follows:

```python
# Example: Expansion relationship
node_k3 = Node('k3')  # Exploring a new sub-topic
node_k2 = Node('k2')  # Exploring a new sub-topic
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k2)  # k0 -> k2 expansion
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k3)  # k0 -> k3 expansion
```

- **Summary**: The user asks the large language model to summarize the content of previous multi-turn dialogues. An example structure is as follows:

```python
# Example: Summary relationship
node_summary = Node('summary')  # Summary node
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k0 -> summary
node_k1.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k1 -> summary
node_k2.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k2 -> summary
```
