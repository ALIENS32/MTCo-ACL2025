### Background Information
We need to construct an evaluation dataset for assessing large models' instruction-following in multi-turn dialogues.
Below, we require you to build multi-turn dialogue data from the bottom up, with the scenario defined and described as follows:
- **Definition**: The prompts given by users at the initial stage are not complete. Through multiple rounds of dialogue with the model, users adjust the prompts by adding or removing constraints based on the feedback from the model, eventually leading to satisfactory results generated by the large model.
- **Description**: Although users wish to accomplish a complex task, due to insufficient clarity of the objective or unclear implementation paths, they need to gradually clarify the direction through exploration and iteration.

The instruction-following data also contain two dimensions of requirements:
- **Task**: Each round of dialogue data should belong to a type of task, which includes: Writing (creative, practical, professional), Reasoning (logical, mathematical, coding), Q&A (common knowledge, comprehension)
- **Constraints**: A prompt contains multiple constraints. Based on the large model's response, each constraint is evaluated to test the large model's ability to follow instructions. Constraint types include: lexical constraints (including keywords, word search), structural constraints (length, template, special language format), semantic constraints (language style, topic, sentiment, creativity), overall constraints (target language, whether providing evidence, consistency, helpfulness)

### Task
Please design multi-turn dialogue data that conforms to the bottom-up scenario and provide corresponding structural descriptions. Only the prompts for each round of dialogue need to be provided, without the responses.
The tasks and the number of constraint types for each round of dialogue are determined by you but should be relatively complex and challenging.
The output should contain two parts: multi-turn dialogue data and structure, in the format described below.

### Format
The prompt data within the multi-turn dialogue must be output in the following format:
```
[
? ? {
? ? ? ? "conv":[
? ? ? ? ? ? {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "turn_id":"<int: turn number>",
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "task_types": "<str: task type>",
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "instruction":"<str: user-given prompt>",
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "constraint_dimensions":[
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "<str: constraint type 1>",
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "<str: constraint type 2>"
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ],
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? "relation":"<str: relationship with the previous dialogue, such as follow-up>",
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ]
? ? ? ? ? ? },
? ? ? ? ? ? {

? ? ? ? ? ? }
? ? ? ? ]
? ? }
]
```
Please use code to describe the structure of the multi-turn dialogue data you have designed, similar to the example given in the previous conversation:
```
class Node:
? ? def __init__(self, name):
? ? ? ? self.name = name
? ? ? ? self.edges = []

? ? def add_follow_up(self, target):
? ? ? ? # Add a follow-up relationship, represented by a solid line
? ? ? ? edge = Edge(self, target, 'solid')
? ? ? ? self.edges.append(edge)

? ? def add_refinement(self, target):
? ? ? ? # Add a refinement relationship, represented by a dashed line
? ? ? ? edge = Edge(self, target, 'dashed')
? ? ? ? self.edges.append(edge)
```
