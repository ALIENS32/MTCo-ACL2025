## Background Information
### Five Basic Dialogue Structures
Our designed dialogue structure includes five fundamental components: follow-up, refinement, recollection, expansion, and summary. We aim to describe the dialogue structure under complex scenarios based on these five basic structures.

### Using Code to Describe the Dialogue Structure
We use the following Python code to depict the above-mentioned five fundamental dialogue structures.

Each instance of the `Node` class represents one round of dialogue, including a question and a response from the large model. The numbers in the node names (e.g., the instance `k1` represents the first round of dialogue) indicate the position of that dialogue round within the entire dialogue sequence.

**Note**: There are **only two types of relationships** between two rounds of dialogue:
- **Follow-up**: The user asks a new question or makes comments based on the large model's response from the previous round of dialogue. This relationship is represented by a solid line.
- **Refinement**: The user modifies or clarifies a previous prompt, possibly due to the need for correcting information or expressing it more clearly. This relationship is indicated by a dashed line.


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.edges = []

    def add_follow_up(self, target): # self and target have a follow-up relationship
        pass

    def add_refinement(self, target): # self and target have a refinement relationship
        pass

# Example: Follow-up Relationship
node_k0 = Node('k0')  # Initial dialogue
node_k1 = Node('k1')  # First round of dialogue
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k1)  # k0 -> k1 follow-up

# Example: Refinement Relationship
node_k2 = Node('k2')  # Second round of dialogue
node_k1.add_refinement(node_k2)  # k1 -> k2 refinement
```

In addition to the aforementioned basic structures, there are also the following dialogue patterns:

- **Recollection**: Users start discussing again based on an earlier round of dialogue. For example, users might return to the initial point of dialogue and ask new questions. The structure is as follows: **a node pointing to a node several rounds later**
```python
# Example: Recollection Relationship
node_kn = Node('kn')  # New dialogue based on early dialogue
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_kn)  # k0 -> kn recollection
```

- **Expansion**: After understanding a topic, users will explore different aspects of that topic in subsequent dialogues. The structure is as follows: **a node pointing to multiple nodes**
```python
# Example: Expansion Relationship
node_k3 = Node('k3')  # Exploring a new sub-topic
node_k2 = Node('k2')  # Exploring a new sub-topic
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k2)  # k0 -> k2 expansion
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_k3)  # k0 -> k3 expansion
```

- **Summary**: Users request the large model to summarize the content based on the previous rounds of dialogue. The structure is as follows: **multiple nodes pointing to one node**
```python
# Example: Summary Relationship
node_summary = Node('summary')  # Summary node
node_k0.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k0 -> summary
node_k1.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k1 -> summary
node_k2.add_follow_up(node_summary)  # k2 -> summary
```

**Assumption: All multi-round dialogue structures are formed by combinations of the above five basic structures**

### Three Complex Scenarios of Multi-Round Dialogue

- **No Purpose (no-purpose)**: Within the same multi-round dialogue, users do not limit themselves to the content of a single theme but may switch topics multiple times during the conversation (each topic has different subjects, tasks, and sub-dialogue structures). In this scenario, multi-round dialogues are actually composed of multiple dialogues belonging to the same theme.
- **Top-Down (up-down)**: Users have a clear plan on how to complete a task and accomplish sub-tasks respectively in multi-round dialogues; or they get a clear plan based on responses in the first few rounds of dialogue and then complete sub-tasks in the subsequent rounds.
- **Bottom-Up (bottom-up)**: Contains two sub-scenarios
    - **Overall Definition**: At the initial stage, the prompts given by the user are incomplete. Through feedback from the model during multiple rounds of dialogue, the user continuously adds or removes constraints to adjust the prompts, eventually leading the large model to generate a result that satisfies the user.
    - **Sub-scenario (ambiguous purpose)**: Although the user wants to complete a complex task, they may be unclear about their goal or the path to achieve it, requiring them to gradually clarify the direction through exploration and iteration.
    - **Sub-scenario (prompt trial)**: The user has a clear and specific goal but is unsure what kind of prompt would lead to a reasonable response from the large model, thus needing to experiment and iteratively modify the prompts until a satisfactory response is received.

**Please deeply understand the differences among the above three scenarios to make accurate judgments in the task**

## Your Task
We need you to analyze the multi-round dialogue data I provide in the following conversation and determine which of the four scenarios (no-purpose, up-down, bottom-up|ambiguous purpose, bottom-up|prompt trial) it belongs to.
